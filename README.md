* These experiments involve predictions for "reduced kWh"during DR. 

* Prediction method used is the Historical average model (previously called as dicuf), and is described in the following paper:
C. Chelmis, S. Aman, M. R. Saeed, M. Frincu and V. K. Prasanna, “Estimating Reduced Consumption for Dynamic Demand Response”, in the AAAI Workshop on Computational Sustainability, Austin, Texas, 2015.

* Number of valid DR events: 79

* Number of buildings involved in the DR experiments: 37

* Time frame of the tests: Nov 2012 to Dec 2013.
